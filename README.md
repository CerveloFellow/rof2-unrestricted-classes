What this solution does:

This solution creates a dinput8.dll that is used for the purpose of dll injection.   By copying this into the same folder as your eqgame.exe for the ROF2 client, it allows you to unlock some UI components that are restricted by class.   For instance Pure Casters(Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer and Wizard) by default do not have any Combat Abilities and cannot open the Combat Abilities Windows, and Pure Melee cannot open the Spell Book.  This will allow you to get past these issues.
